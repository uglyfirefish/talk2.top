Romans 3:21-31 Study Guide

This study guide applies the Double Discourse Theory (DDT) to Romans 3:21-31, integrating traditional exegesis with a focus on performative language and faith-driven action.

1. Connecting to Life





Question: When do you feel “not good enough” or driven to “prove” your worth?



Context: Romans 1:18-3:20 establishes universal sinfulness. Romans 3:21 introduces God’s solution: “But now…”

2. Cognitive Understanding

Read Romans 3:21-31 aloud or silently.

Guiding Questions





What is “God’s righteousness” (v.21)? How does it differ from the “law”?



What does “justified freely” (v.24) mean? Explore “redemption” and “propitiation” (v.25) in their historical context.



How does this passage balance God’s justice and justification (v.25-26)?



Why does Paul say there’s “no boasting” (v.27)? How does this affect Jew-Gentile relations?



What does “we uphold the law” (v.31) mean?

3. DDT Insights

Performative Language





Phrases like “God’s righteousness revealed” and “justified freely” are declarations of a cosmic event. How do they reshape reality?



What is Paul “doing” with his words? (Proclaiming? Redefining? Inviting?)

Root Connection





What attributes of God are revealed? (Initiator, just, gracious)



How does faith act as a channel to God’s grace (v.22, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31)?

Dialogue of Being





How does accepting this message change your identity? (From sinner to justified)

Dialogue of Becoming





How might “no boasting” shape relationships? What lifestyle does “upholding the law” suggest?

4. Seaming the Crack

Reflection





Do you live as one “justified by faith,” or do you still try to “earn” worth? Where’s the gap?



What specific faith action does this text invite? (e.g., gratitude, changed attitudes, releasing burdens)

Group Sharing





Share struggles in aligning belief and action.



Discuss your faith action commitment.

Prayer





Pray for the Spirit’s help to live out this truth.

5. Closing
